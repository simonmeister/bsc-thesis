We have introduced a extension on top of region-based convolutional networks to enable object motion estimation
in parallel to instance segmentation.

\subsection{Future Work}
Due to the amount of supervision required by the different components of the network
and the complexity of the optimization problem,
we trained Motion R-CNN on the simple synthetic Virtual KITTI dataset.
A next step would be the training on
For example, we can first pre-train the RPN on a object detection dataset like
Cityscapes. As soon as the RPN works reliably, we could then do alternating
steps of training on, for example, Cityscapes and the KITTI stereo and optical flow datasets.
On KITTI stereo and flow, we could run the instance segmentation component in testing mode and only penalize
the motion losses and depth prediction, as no instance segmentation ground truth exists. % TODO depth prediction ?!
On Cityscapes, we could continue train the full instance segmentation Mask R-CNN to
improve detection and masks and avoid any forgetting effects.
