\subsection{Motivation \& Goals}

% introduce problem to sovle
% mention classical non deep-learning works, then say it would be nice to go end-to-end deep

Recently, SfM-Net \cite{SfmNet} introduced an end-to-end deep learning approach for predicting depth
and dense optical flow in monocular image sequences based on estimating the 3D motion of individual objects and the camera.
SfM-Net predicts a batch of binary full image masks specyfing the object memberships of individual pixels with a standard encoder-decoder
network for pixel-wise prediction. A fully connected network branching off the encoder predicts a 3D motion for each object.
However, due to the fixed number of objects masks, the system can only predict a small number of motions and
often fails to properly segment the pixels into the correct masks or assigns background pixels to object motions.

Thus, this approach is very unlikely to scale to dynamic scenes with a potentially
large number of diverse objects due to the inflexible nature of their instance segmentation technique.

A scalable approach to instance segmentation based on region-based convolutional networks
was recently introduced with Mask R-CNN \cite{MaskRCNN}, which inherits the ability to detect
a large number of objects from a large number of classes at once from Faster R-CNN
and predicts pixel-precise segmentation masks for each detected object.

We propose \emph{Motion R-CNN}, which combines the scalable instance segmentation capabilities of
Mask R-CNN with the end-to-end 3D motion estimation approach introduced with SfM-Net.
For this, we naturally integrate 3D motion prediction for individual objects into the per-RoI R-CNN head
in parallel to classification and bounding box refinement.

\subsection{Related Work}

\paragraph{Deep networks for optical flow and scene flow}

\paragraph{Deep networks for 3D motion estimation}
End-to-end deep learning for predicting rigid 3D object motions was first introduced with
SE3-Nets \cite{SE3Nets}, which take raw 3D point clouds as input and produce a segmentation
of the points into objects together with the 3D motion of each object.
Bringing this idea to the context of image sequences, SfM-Net \cite{SfmNet} takes two consecutive frames and
estimates a segmentation of pixels into objects together with their 3D motions between the frames.
In addition, SfM-Net predicts dense depth and camera motion to obtain full 3D scene flow from end-to-end deep learning.
For supervision, SfM-Net penalizes the dense optical flow composed from the 3D motions and depth estimate
with a brightness constancy proxy loss.



Recently, deep CNN-based recognition was combined with energy-based 3D scene flow estimation \cite{Behl2017ICCV}.
